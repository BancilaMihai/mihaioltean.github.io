	The possibility of using switchable glass (also called smart windows) 
	technology for Evolvable Hardware tasks is suggested in this paper. 
	Switchable glass technology basically means controlling the transmission of 
	light through windows by using electrical power. By applying a variable 
	voltage to the window we can continuously vary the amount of transmitted 
	light. Three existing technologies are reviewed in this paper: 
	Electrochromic Devices, Suspended Particle Devices and Liquid Crystal 
	Devices. An Evolvable Hardware application for a light-based device is 
	described. The proposed device can be used for solving an entire class of 
	problems, instead of one problem only as in the case of other dedicated 
	hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc1">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</H2><!--SEC END -->

Intrinsic Evolvable Hardware (EHW) employs the Darwinian principle of evolution 
directly into hardware. Several devices have been used so far in this purpose: 
Field Programmable Gate Array [<A HREF="#Thompson1"><CITE>16</CITE></A>], Field 
Programmable Transistor Array [<A HREF="#Stoica1"><CITE>15</CITE></A>], Field 
Programmable Analog Array [<A HREF="#Flockton"><CITE>3</CITE></A>] and Liquid 
Crystal [<A HREF="#Miller1"><CITE>11</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#Miller2"><CITE>
12</CITE></A>]. <BR>
<BR>
In this paper we suggest the use of switchable glass (commercially known as 
smart windows) for Evolvable Hardware purposes. Because switchable glass affects 
only the transmitted light, we can used this technology for light-based 
computations only.<BR>
<BR>
In the area of light control, there are three main technologies: Electrochromic 
Devices, Suspended Particle Devices and Liquid Crystal Devices. Electrochromic 
Devices technology is based on chemical reactions whereas Suspended Particle 
Devices technology uses field effects. These technologies are widely used to 
manufacture smart windows [<A HREF="#LaPointe"><CITE>9</CITE></A>]. These types 
of glass can be automatically controlled to adjust the amount of light passing 
through them.<BR>
<BR>
Suspended Particle Device refers to rod-like particles suspended in a fluid. 
With no applied voltage, the particles are randomly oriented and block light 
(dark state). When a voltage is applied, the particles align with the electric 
field and let light though (light state). By varying the applied voltage, we can 
continuously vary the amount of transmitted light.<BR>
<BR>
Electrochromic glass becomes translucent when voltage is added and are 
transparent when voltage is taken away. Like suspended particle devices, 
electrochromic windows can be adjusted to allow varying levels of visibility.<BR>
<BR>
Liquid crystal glasses become transparent when a voltage is added and have an 
opaque behavior when there is no electrical power applied. However, liquid 
crystal glass has only 2 states: opaque and transparent with no other degrees of 
visibility.<BR>
<BR>
The paper is structured as follows: The properties of intrisic EHW systems are 
briefly described in section <A HREF="#Properties">2</A>. Section <A HREF="#overview">
3</A> reviews the current directions in the field of switchable glasses. A 
possible EHW application of switchable glass is presented in section <A HREF="#application">
5</A>. Conclusions and further work directions are given in section <A HREF="#conclusions">
6</A>.<BR>

<A NAME="Properties"></A>
According to [<A HREF="#Miller2"><CITE>12</CITE></A>] there are several 
characteristics that a material should have in order to become a possible 
candidate for EHW tasks:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">the material should be configurable 
	by applying some electrical power or any other source of energy (such as 
	light),
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the material should affect an incident signal (optical or 
electronic),
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the material should be able to be reset to its original 
state.</UL>
In this paper we suggest the possibility of using switchable glass as a platform 
for EHW tasks. This kind of material has all the properties required by the EHW 
tasks: 
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">the switchable glass can change its 
	degree of opaqueness by applying some electrical power,
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the switchable glass affects the quantity of light that 
pass through it,
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the switchable glass is able to be reset to its original 
state by removing the source of power.</UL>
Because switchable glass affects only the transmitted light, we can used this 
technology for light-based computations only.<BR>

Three existing technologies in the field of switchable glasses are briefly 
described in this section. These technologies are: Suspended-particle devices, 
Electrochromic devices and Liquid crystal devices.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="spd"></A>
Suspended Particle Devices (SPDs) [<A HREF="#Harary"><CITE>7</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#howstuffworks"><CITE>
19</CITE></A>], also called <I>light valves</I> use either a liquid suspension 
or a film within which droplets of liquid suspension are distributed. 
Light-absorbing microscopic particles are dispersed within the liquid 
suspension. The liquid suspension or film is then enclosed between two glass or 
plastic plates coated with a transparent conductive material. The mechanism 
behind SPD is similar to that of the dielectric in a parallel-plate capacitor 
which means that the atoms of the dielectric are polarized by the electric 
field. When an electrical voltage is applied to the suspension via the coatings, 
the particles are forced to align. <BR>
<BR>
This allows a range of transparency where light transmission can be rapidly 
varied to any degree desired depending upon the voltage applied. <BR>
<BR>
An example of how SPD works is given in Figure <A HREF="#fig_spd">1</A>.

The way in which SPD glass works is very simple, if one thinks of SPDs as light 
valves. In a SPD window, millions of SPDs are placed between two panels of glass 
or plastic. When electricity comes into contact with the SPDs via the conductive 
coating, they line up in a straight line and allow light to flow through. Once 
the electricity is taken away, they move back into a random pattern and block 
light. When the amount of voltage is decreased, the window darkens until it's 
completely dark after all electricity is taken away. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC subsection Electrochromic devices-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc5">3.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Electrochromic devices</H3><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="Electrochromic"></A>
Electrochromic windows [<A HREF="#Granqvist"><CITE>4</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#LaPointe"><CITE>
9</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#Mortimer"><CITE>13</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#howstuffworks"><CITE>
19</CITE></A>] are made of special materials that have electrochromic 
properties. <I>Electrochromic</I> basically describes materials that can change 
color when energized by an electrical current. Electricity generates a chemical 
reaction in this material. This reaction (like any chemical reaction) changes 
the properties of the material. In this particular case, the reaction changes 
the way the material reflects and absorbs light. In some other electrochromic 
materials, the change is between different colors. In electrochromic windows, 
the material changes between colored (reflecting light of some color) and 
transparent (not reflecting any light). <BR>
<BR>
At its most basic level, an electrochromic window needs this sort of 
electrochromic material and an electrode system to change its chemical state 
from colored to transparent and back again.<BR>
<BR>
Electrochromic glass is made by sandwiching certain materials between two panes 
of glass. Figure <A HREF="#fig_chromic">2</A> shows the materials inside one 
basic electrochromic window system and the way in which this system works.

	layer of conducting oxide, a second glass or plastic panel. We have kept the 
	glass panels in order to show how this technology works. When switched off, 
	an electrochromic window remains transparent (left side). When switched on, 
	a low volt of electricity makes the electrochromic window translucent (right 
	side).</DIV><BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="fig_chromic"></A>
<DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE> 
In the design shown in Figure <A HREF="#fig_chromic">2</A>, the chemical 
reaction at work is an oxidation reaction &#8211; a reaction in which molecules in a 
compound lose an electron. Ions in the sandwiched electrochromic layer are what 
allow it to change from translucent to transparent. It's these ions that allow 
it to absorb light. A power source is wired to the two conducting oxide layers, 
and a voltage drives the ions from the ion storage layer, through the ion 
conducting layer and into the electrochromic layer. This makes the glass opaque. 
By shutting off the voltage, the ions are driven out of the electrochromic 
layers and into the ion storage layer. When the ions leave the electrochromic 
layer, the window regains its transparency. <BR>
<BR>
With an electrochromic smart-window, it only requires electricity to make the 
initial change in opacity. Maintaining a particular shade does not require 
constant voltage. One only needs to apply enough voltage to make the change, and 
then enough to reverse the change.<BR>

Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals (PDLCs), [<A HREF="#khoo"><CITE>8</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#howstuffworks"><CITE>

in the field of switchable windows. <BR>
<BR>
An example of how LCD works is given in Figure <A HREF="#fig_lcd">3</A>.

<A NAME="fig_lcd"></A>
<DIV CLASS="center"><HR WIDTH="80%" SIZE=2></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
In the opaque state, the glass diffuses direct sunlight and eliminates 99 
percent of the ultraviolet rays.<BR>
<BR>
LCDs operate on the principle of electrically controlled light scattering. They 
consist of liquid crystal droplets surrounded by a polymer mixture sandwiched 
between two pieces of conducting glass. When no electricity is applied the 
liquid crystal droplets are randomly oriented, creating an opaque state. When 
electricity is applied the liquid crystals align parallel to the electric field 
and light passes through, creating a transparent state.<BR>
<BR>
LCD windows can only be in one of the two states: transparent or opaque. There 
is nothing between these states, regardless how much electrical power is 
applied.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Advantages and weaknesses-->

<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc7">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantages and weaknesses</H2><!--SEC END -->

A comparison of the features of the switchable glasses technologies is given in 
Table <A HREF="#tab_diference">1</A>.<BR>
<BR>
An important advantage of Suspended-Particles Devices and Electrochromic Devices 
is their ability to continuously vary the amount of transmitted light based on 
continuous variations of the applied electrical power. This feature makes SPDs 
and ECDs very suitable for a large number of problems whose parameters are 
real-valued. By contrast, Liquid Crystal Devices are of ON-OFF type: they can 
have only 2 states.<BR>
<BR>
A possible drawback is the speed of performing the changes. As a general remark, 
the speed is directly connected to the glass surface. A bigger surface requires 
more time to change its state than a smaller surface. However, for EHW tasks the 
required surface can be microscopic, which requires less than 1 microsecond to 
perform a complete cycle (in the case of SPDs). <BR>
<BR>
Because ECDs depend on ion injection and chemical reactions, the process is 
inherently slow. However, SPDs depend on a field effect, thus responding in very 
short time. As the technology advances we can expect to have smart glass which 
will respond faster to the applied electrical power.<BR>

<A NAME="application"></A>
In this section we describe an application for solving the 0/1 knapsack problem 
[<A HREF="#Chvatal"><CITE>2</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#Martello"><CITE>

<!--TOC subsection The knapsack problem-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc9">5.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The knapsack problem</H3><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="knapsack_problem"></A>
In this problem we have a set <I>M</I> of <I>n</I> items. Each item has its own 
weight <I>w</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB>. We also have a knapsack of capacity <I>C</I>. 
We have to fill the knapsack using some objects in the set <I>M</I> so that:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">the total weight of the objects in 
	the knapsack does not exceed the given capacity <I>C</I>,
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">the difference between <I>C</I> and the sum of the

Without losing the generality we may assume that each weight is a real number 
between 0 and 1. Otherwise we can scale them to that interval.<BR>

The knapsack problem belongs to the class of NP-Complete problems [<A HREF="#Chvatal"><CITE>2</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#garey"><CITE>

Evolutionary algorithms have been extensively used for solving this problem and 
its countless variants [<A HREF="#Cotta"><CITE>1</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#grosan"><CITE>

We use a standard representation of a chromosome: a binary string <I>x</I> of 
length <I>n</I>. Each position <I>x</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> is filled with either 
1 (meaning that the object is in the knapsack) or 0 (meaning that the object is 
not in the knapsack). The fitness is equal to the difference, in absolute value, 
between <I>C</I> and the sum of the objects in the knapsack. If the capacity C 
is exceeded, the corresponding chromosome will have the fitness equal to &#8734;. The 
fitness of a chromosome is computed by the EHW device (see section <A HREF="#ehw_device">
5.3</A>).<BR>

<!--TOC subsection The EHW device-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc11">5.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The EHW device</H3><!--SEC END -->

<A NAME="ehw_device"></A>
The EHW device (used for computing the fitness of a chromosome) consists in 5 
main parts:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">several continuous sources of light. 
	Their number is equal to <I>n</I> (the number of objects in the set <I>M</I>).<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">an array of <I>n</I> LCD cells. Each cell is an 
reconfigurable LCD glass which lets or does not let the light to pass through. 
This array has the same structure as the structure of the chromosome whose 
fitness is computed: 1 - the light is not blocked and 0 - the light is blocked. 
This array will be reconfigured (by applying a predefined electric power) by the 
computer everytime when the fitness of a chromosome needs to be computed.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">an array of <I>n</I> SPD cells. Each cell is an SPD glass 
which allows a variable degree of light to pass through. This array encodes the 
weights of the given objects. When we have defined the problem (see section <A HREF="#knapsack_problem">
5.1</A>) we have imposed a restriction that each weight is between 0 and 1. Thus 
each SPD cell is configured to let <I>w</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB>*100% of the 
incoming light to pass through. If <I>w</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> = 1 it means that 
the corresponding glass is fully transparent allowing to pass 100% of the 
incoming light. When <I>w</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> is near to 0 means that the 
corresponding glass blocks almost all of the incoming light. This array of SPD 
cells actually encodes the problem to be solved. This is why it should be kept 
fixed during a run. However, when the problem is changed (i.e. the weights of 
the objects are changed) we can reconfigure this SPD array too. This feature 
gives us a great generalization ability.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">The effect of these arrays (LCD and SPD), when a light is 
applied, is equivalent to performing, for each object, the multiplication <I>x</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB>*<I>w</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB>. 
For computing the sum of the previously generated values we can use a biconvex 
lens. This lens will focus all rays in a given point also called focal point. 
The lens is a very important piece of this device, because it can compute a sum 
of numbers in O(1) time. The conventional devices (electrically powered) can do 
this operation in O(<I>n</I>) time.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">The light is then captured by a solar cell (photo cell) 
which transforms it into electric power, which is later sent to computer as a 
analog signal. The computer will calculate the actual fitness based on the 
differences between <I>C</I> and the value generated by the EHW device.</UL>
<!--TOC subsection How the system works?-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc12">5.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;How the system works?</H3><!--SEC END -->

The system works as follows (see also Figure <A HREF="#fig_knapsack_computer">4</A>):
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The SPDs cells are reconfigured at 
	the beginning of the search in order to encode the knapsack problem (i.e.

	solved.<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">A computer runs an Evolutionary Algorithm for solving the 
knapsack problem as described in section <A HREF="#eas_knapsack">5.2</A>.<BR>

<LI CLASS="li-itemize">When the fitness of a chromosome needs to be computed its 
structure will be downloaded into the LCD array. This means that the LCD array 
will be reconfigured (by applying/removing some electrical power to each of its

pass through a cell only if the corresponding object is in the knapsack 
(according to the current chromosome).<BR>
<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">When the light rays will pass the second layer (SPDs 
array), they will have a power which reflects the degree of opaqueness of each

and the resulting ray will be captured by a solar cell. The signal, which is

<BR>
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">The computer calculates the fitness by comparing value <I>

<!--TOC subsection Advantages-->

<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc13">5.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantages</H3><!--SEC END -->

Because of its two levels of reconfigurability, this EHW device has an important 
advantage: it can be used for solving an entire class of knapsack problems, 
without changing the device. The second array (the array of SPD cells) allows us 
to reconfigure the weights, thus permitting to encode and solve all knapsack 
problems which have no more than <I>n</I> objects. However, the maximum number 
of objects, for a given device, cannot be modified.<BR>
<BR>
Another important advantage is given by the use of the biconvex lens. This type 
of lens allows us to compute the sum <I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>*<I>w</I><SUB>1</SUB>+<I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>*<I>w</I><SUB>2</SUB>+...+<I>x</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB>*<I>w</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB> 
in O(1) time by focusing the entire light to a single spot. Note that a standard 
computer needs O(<I>n</I>) steps to do this operation.

<A NAME="conclusions"></A>
The possibility of using switchable glass for Evolvable Hardware tasks has been 
suggested in this paper. Three commercially available technologies in the field 
of smart windows have been reviewed. Strengths and weaknesses of these 
technologies have been deeply presented.<BR>
<BR>
A potential application of these technologies for evolution <I>in materio</I> 
tasks has been described.<BR>
<BR>
Further efforts will be focused on two directions: 
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">implementing the proposed hardware,
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">finding new applications which are suitable for this 
model,
<LI CLASS="li-itemize">applying the switchable glass to reversible computing [<A HREF="#oltean"><CITE>14</CITE></A>]. 
This task could be possible because the glass is able to restore its original 
state after removing the source of energy.</UL>
