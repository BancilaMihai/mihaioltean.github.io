<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are 
powerful tools used for solving difficult real-world problems. They have 
been developed in order to solve some real-world problems that the classical 
(mathematical) methods failed to successfully tackle. Many of these unsolved 
problems are (or could be turned into) optimization problems. The solving of an 
optimization problem means finding solutions that maximize or minimize a 
criteria function.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Evolutionary Algorithms have 
been proposed for dealing with optimization problems. Many solution 
representations and search operators have been proposed and tested within a wide 
range of evolutionary models. There are several natural questions to be answered 
in all these evolutionary models: <br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the optimal population size?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the optimal individual representation?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the optimal probabilities for applying specific 
genetic operators?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the optimal number of generations before halting the 
evolution?<br>
</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A breakthrough arose in 1995 when 
Wolpert and McReady unveiled their work on <i>No Free Lunch</i> (NFL) theorems 
for <i>Search</i> and <i>Optimization</i>. The <i>No Free Lunch</i> theorems 
state that all the black-box algorithms have the same average performance over 
the entire set of optimization problems. (A black-box algorithm does not take 
into account any information about the problem or the particular instance being 
solved.) The magnitude of the NFL results stroke all the efforts for developing 
a universal black-box optimization algorithm capable of solving all the 
optimization problems in the best manner.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their attempt for solving 
problems, men delegated computers to develop algorithms capable of performing 
certain tasks. The most prominent effort in this direction is Genetic 
Programming (GP), an evolutionary technique used for breeding a population of 
computer programs. Instead of evolving solutions for a particular problem 
instance, GP is mainly intended for discovering computer programs capable of 
solving particular classes of optimization problems. (This statement is only 
partially true since the discovery of computer programs may also be viewed as a 
technique for solving a particular problem input. For instance, the problem may 
be here: &quot;Find a computer program that calculates the sum of the elements of an 
array of integers.&quot;).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many such approaches in 
literature concerning GP. Noticeable effort has been dedicated for evolving 
deterministic computer programs capable of solving specific problems such as 
symbolic regression,&nbsp; classification etc.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of evolving such 
deterministic computer programs we will evolve a full-featured evolutionary 
algorithm (i.e. the output of our main program will be an EA capable of 
performing a given task). Thus, we will work with EAs at two levels: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first (macro) level consists in a steady-state EA 
which uses a fixed population size, a fixed mutation probability, a fixed 
crossover probability etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second (micro) level consists in the solutions encoded 
in a chromosome of the first level EA.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rules employed by the evolved EAs 
are not preprogrammed. These rules are automatically discovered by the 
evolution. The evolved EA is a generational one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This research was motivated by the 
need of answering several important questions concerning Evolutionary 
Algorithms. The most important question is </p>

<p> <i>Can Evolutionary Algorithms be 
automatically synthesized by using only the information about the problem being 
solved?</i>. </p>

<p>And, if yes, which are the genetic operators that have to be used in 
conjunction with an EA (for a given problem)? Moreover, we are also interested 
to find the optimal (or near-optimal) sequence of genetic operations 
(selections, crossovers and mutations) to be performed during a generation of an 
Evolutionary Algorithm for a particular problem. For instance, in a standard GA 
the sequence is the following: selection, recombination and mutation. But, how 
do we know that scheme is the best for a particular problem (or problem 
instance)? We better let the evolution to find the answer for us.</p>
